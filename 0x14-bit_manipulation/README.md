**Bit Manipulation**
This  Project contains C Tacks for learning about bit manipulation

**Tasks Completed**

 #0.0 '0-binary_to_uint' : contains function that converts a binary number to an _unsigned int_ .
 #1.1 '1-print_binary' :contains function that print the binary representation of a number.
 #2.10 '2-get_bit' : contains function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
 #3.11 '3-set_bit' : contains function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a give index.
 #4.100 '4-clear_bit' : contains function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
 #5.101 '5-flip_bits': contains function that return number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
 #6. Endianness '100-get_endianness' : contains function that checks the endianness
 #7. Crackme3 '101-password' : contains the password for this program.
